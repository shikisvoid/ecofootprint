## Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# 1. Check dependencies
npm list @google-cloud/dialogflow uuid

# 2. Verify environment template
cat .env.example

# 3. Test development server
npm run dev

# 4. Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit

# 5. Verify file structure
ls -la dialogflow/
ls -la src/services/dialogflow*
ls -la src/components/ChatBot.tsx
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed

### Issue: ChatBot not appearing
**Solution**: 
- Check if user is authenticated
- Verify AuthContext is properly wrapped around the app
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Dialogflow responses not working
**Solution**:
- Verify webhook URL is correct
- Check that intents are properly imported
- Test individual intents in Dialogflow simulator

### Issue: Environment variables not loading
**Solution**:
- Ensure `.env` file is in project root
- Verify all required variables are set
- Restart development server after changes

## Success Indicators

### ‚úÖ **Technical Success**
- No TypeScript compilation errors
- All services import correctly
- ChatBot renders without errors
- Webhook responses are received

### ‚úÖ **Functional Success**
- Users can open chat interface
- Bot responds to welcome messages
- Carbon tracking conversations work
- Environmental data queries function
- Recommendations are provided

### ‚úÖ **Integration Success**
- User authentication flows properly
- Carbon entries are saved to database
- Real-time environmental data is fetched
- User-specific responses are generated

## Performance Benchmarks

- **Initial load time**: < 3 seconds
- **Chat interface open**: < 1 second
- **Message response time**: < 2 seconds
- **Data query response**: < 3 seconds

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables secured
- [ ] Service account permissions minimal
- [ ] User input sanitization implemented
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for webhook
- [ ] Authentication verified for all requests

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur after deployment:

1. **Immediate**: Disable ChatBot component
2. **Short-term**: Revert to previous deployment
3. **Investigation**: Check logs and error reports
4. **Fix**: Address issues in development
5. **Re-deploy**: Test thoroughly before re-enabling
